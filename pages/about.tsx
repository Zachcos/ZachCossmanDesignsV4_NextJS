          I began my interest in design when I was in my early teens. My cousin
          and I used to find Photoshop tutorials that we liked and would sit on
          the phone for hours while we completed them. (We compared our results
          by sending them through AOL Instant Messenger... ‚úåüèªüë¥üèª‚úåüèª) From there, I
          dabbled in (terrible) Flash animations and eventually found my footing
          tinkering with late-90's web builders like Yahoo! GeoCities, where the
          restrictions of that platform made me want to learn how to write my
          own code.
          <br />
          <br />
          My first sites were Photoshop designs cut into pieces and reassembled
          for the web with code from Adobe Dreamweaver. Just as I was publishing
          my first site, I got my first dose of just how quickly things change
          in the world of web design and development and began the never-ending
          journey of learning the new tools of the trade. Through table layouts,
          floats, and the rest, I have stayed on a constant hunt for the
          technologies that make sites faster and more versatile, with a
          majority of my current work being built on React with GatsbyJS for
          static-site generation.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since the mid 2000's I have been working on a freelance basis with a
          variety of clients, helping them establish brand identities and better
          reach their audiences.

          When I'm not behind the computer, you can find me acting on stage or
          playing music, or looking for the nearest Starbucks. ‚òïÔ∏è

          My goal is to create designs that are unique, but simple and
          straightforward. I use minimalism with an emphasis on typography and
          functional design to bring the best possible experience to the end
          user.
